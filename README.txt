INTRODUCTION

Rooms is a family of modules that enable you to manage Booking for hotels, b&bs
and vacation rentals.

It builds on the Drupal CMS (drupal.org) and its modules.


To try out Rooms in this early stage do the following:

1. Install and activate all the modules.

2. Visit admin/rooms/unit-types and create a unit type (e.g. standard double room)

3. Visit admin/rooms/units and create a couple of bookable units

4. Set availability and pricing

5. Got to /booking and do an availability search

For the rest join us in the issue queues for now and work with us to create a great
booking solution for Drupal!
